# MINITALK

This project is all about signals between client/server.

I found it very interesting and introductive to the beautiful world of networking.

To run the program, just open the terminal in its folder and type `make`, then you'll have two files (server / client indeed),
all you have to do is run the server first using `./server`, it'll print out its PID, then you can run client with the server's PID and a string -> `./client PID "any string you want to print"`.


Final grade: 125/100
